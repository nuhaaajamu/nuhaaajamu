## Hi! I'm Nuhaa

I’m a computer science student exploring front-end development and creative applications of technology. I’m especially interested in fashion tech and human-centered digital experiences, spaces where design, culture, and engineering come together

**This GitHub is an evolving archive of my learning, experiments, and ideas, where I explore both the *technical* and *creative* sides of building, and how technology can be used with intention**

### Current Focus:
- Front-end fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- UI and experience-driven thinking
- Exploring how technology can amplify creativity, self-expression, and thoughtful design
