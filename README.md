### Who am I?
I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who recently made the transition from biology to computer science. Why Computer Science? For me, it’s about impact and creativity. When I was studying biology, I was fascinated by the problems we were trying to solve, but I often felt like an observer, analyzing systems rather than building solutions. Programming appealed to me because of the way in which I get to be hands-on, using technology to create, problem-solve, and bring ideas to life. Coding isn’t just about logic, it’s a creative process through brainstorming unique solutions, designing innovative tools, and thinking outside the box to tackle challenges. As someone who has always been drawn to creative expression, whether through writing, art, or problem-solving, programming gives me an outlet to channel that creativity into something tangible and impactful. 

**I don’t just want to study problems, I want to solve them.**
